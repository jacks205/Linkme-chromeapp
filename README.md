Linkme (Chrome Extension)
===============
Linkme is a utility app that helps the common problem of the inability to copy/paste text cross-platform.

The Problem!
------------
One issue I personally have is chatting with friends and family on my phone and wanting to link them a website or video that I currently have on my computer. I would resort to starting a draft in Gmail and then open the Gmail app on my phone and copy the link there, and then be able to paste it to the conversation. I wish to fix that problem! I want to create a chrome extension and an iOS/Android app that can easily cut the middleman of Gmail drafts.

Mission
-------
Create an app that allows users to save text that can be easily copy/paste'd on any platform they have the app on. Essentially a bookmark manager for text.

Goals
------
* [Chrome Extension]()
* [iOS App]()
* [Android App]()
* Other platforms?
